									<h3 class="major">FAQ</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>What is a copy editor and what do they do?<br>
										A copy editor is a professional who reviews and revises written material to improve its accuracy, clarity, and readability by checking for errors and inconsistencies. They work to make sure the final text is polished, error-free, and easy to understand.
									</li>
									<li>How do I know if I need a copy editor?	 
										<br>
										Any written material, be it a manuscript, blog post, brochure, report, research paper, or website, can benefit from the expertise of a copy editor. If you find yourself uncertain of the grammatical accuracy, punctuation, spelling, syntax, or consistency of your text, or if you question the readability or effectiveness of your message, a copy editor can assist you in revising and improving your work.
									</li>
									<li>How do you charge for your services?
										<br>
										Copy editors charge by the hour, by the word, by the page (assuming 250 words per page or the standard double-spaced 12-pt font with 1-inch margins), or by the total word count.
									</li>
									<li>How do you ensure that my voice and style are preserved in the editing process?
